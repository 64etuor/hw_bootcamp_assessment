2. Yesterady my mom cooked a dish and I ate it well.
3. I'm going to watch a movie with my friends this weekend. I'm so excited!",NORMAL,"1. The first sentence is grammatically correct and natural. No changes needed.
2. The second sentence has a minor spelling error ('Yesterady' should be 'Yesterday'). Additionally, 'ate it well' is not a natural expression in English. 'Enjoyed it' is more appropriate and natural.
3. The third sentence is mostly natural, but 'so excited' can be slightly improved to 'really excited' for better emphasis and naturalness. Overall, the sentences are clear and convey the intended meaning effectively.","1. I'm going to have dinner with my family this evening.
